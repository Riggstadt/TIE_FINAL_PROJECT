The final product of this project was a set of manufacturing files for PCB production, which was accompanied by a thorough technical documentation concerning circuit functionality and board design optimizations. 

This project served as the pelude to further PCB projects during my Electrotechnical Engineering degree, one of which can be seen <a href="https://github.com/Riggstadt/PROIECT_1_ETTI/tree/main">here</a>.
