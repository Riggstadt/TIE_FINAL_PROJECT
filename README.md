# TIE_FINAL_PROJECT
This project was meant to familiarize us with PCB layout best practices and Design for Manufacturing (DFM).

The final product of this project was a set of manufacturing files for PCB production, accompanied by a thorough technical documentation, concerning circuit functionality and board design optimizations.

For a complete picture of the project, see <a href="Orga de lumini.pdf">the documentation</a>.
